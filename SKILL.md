# App Store Review Guidelines Checker

Comprehensive guide for evaluating iOS, macOS, tvOS, watchOS, and visionOS app code against Apple's App Store Review Guidelines. This skill covers EVERY guideline point to identify potential rejection issues before submission.

**Supports:** Swift, Objective-C, React Native, and Expo apps

## When to Apply

Use this skill when:
- Preparing an app for App Store submission
- Reviewing code for compliance issues
- Implementing features that may trigger review concerns
- Auditing existing apps for guideline violations
- Building features involving payments, user data, or sensitive content

## Guideline Sections

Read individual rule files for detailed explanations, checklists, and code examples:

| Section | File | Key Topics |
|---------|------|------------|
| **1. Safety** | [rules/1-safety.md](rules/1-safety.md) | Objectionable content, UGC moderation, Kids Category, physical harm, data security |
| **2. Performance** | [rules/2-performance.md](rules/2-performance.md) | App completeness, metadata accuracy, hardware compatibility, software requirements |
| **3. Business** | [rules/3-business.md](rules/3-business.md) | In-app purchase, subscriptions, cryptocurrencies, other business models |
| **4. Design** | [rules/4-design.md](rules/4-design.md) | Copycats, minimum functionality, spam, extensions, Apple services, login |
| **5. Legal** | [rules/5-legal.md](rules/5-legal.md) | Privacy, data collection, intellectual property, gambling, VPN, MDM |

## Risk Levels by Category

| Risk Level | Category | Section | Common Rejection Reasons |
|------------|----------|---------|--------------------------|
| CRITICAL | Privacy & Data | 5.1 | Missing privacy policy, unauthorized data collection |
| CRITICAL | Payments | 3.1 | Bypassing in-app purchase, unclear pricing |
| HIGH | Safety | 1.x | Objectionable content, inadequate UGC moderation |
| HIGH | Performance | 2.x | Crashes, incomplete features, deprecated APIs |
| MEDIUM | Design | 4.x | Copycat apps, minimum functionality issues |
| MEDIUM | Legal | 5.x | IP violations, gambling without license |

## Quick Reference: High-Risk Rejection Patterns

### Critical Issues (Immediate Rejection)

**Swift:**
```swift
// 🔴 Private API usage
let selector = NSSelectorFromString("_privateMethod")

// 🔴 Hardcoded secrets
let apiKey = "sk_live_xxxxx"

// 🔴 External payment for digital goods
func purchaseDigitalContent() {
    openStripeCheckout() // Use StoreKit instead
}
```

**React Native / Expo:**
```typescript
// 🔴 Hardcoded secrets in JS bundle
const API_KEY = 'sk_live_xxxxx'; // REJECTION

// 🔴 External payment for digital goods
Linking.openURL('https://stripe.com/checkout'); // Use react-native-iap

// 🔴 Dynamic code execution
eval(downloadedCode); // REJECTION

// 🔴 Major feature changes via CodePush/expo-updates
// OTA updates for bug fixes only, not new features!
```

### High-Risk Issues

**Swift:**
```swift
// 🟡 Missing ATT when using ad SDKs
import FacebookAds // Without ATTrackingManager

// 🟡 Account creation without deletion
func createAccount() { } // But no deleteAccount()
```

**React Native / Expo:**
```typescript
// 🟡 Missing ATT (use expo-tracking-transparency)
import analytics from '@react-native-firebase/analytics';
analytics().logEvent('event'); // Without ATT prompt = REJECTION

// 🟡 Account deletion via website only
Linking.openURL('https://example.com/delete'); // Must be in-app!

// 🟡 Social login without Sign in with Apple
<GoogleSigninButton /> // Must also offer Apple login!
```

### Medium-Risk Issues

```typescript
// 🟠 Vague purpose strings in Info.plist
"This app needs camera access" // Be specific!

// 🟠 WebView-only app (insufficient native functionality)
const App = () => <WebView source={{ uri: 'https://site.com' }} />;

// 🟠 References to Android in iOS app
const text = "Also available on Android"; // REJECTION

// 🟠 console.log in production
console.log('debug'); // Remove or wrap in __DEV__
```
